## Environment normalisation:
/.bundle/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
# .rvmrc
# NOTE I'm deliberately ignoring this advice in the interests of transparency,
#      even though I'm currently using rvm 1.23.13
